# Wikipedia API

## Description

<p>We all have heard about Wikipedia and used it multiple times, right? Then why not create a search page for Wikipedia articles? Their API documentation is quite complex, but we will manage!</p>

<p>The <b>Wikipedia API Challenge</b> is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6) and uses Axios to communicate with the API. We will also use async/await and use the try...catch statement, so let's get started!</p>
